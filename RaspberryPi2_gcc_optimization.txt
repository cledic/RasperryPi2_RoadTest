For gcc 4.8 I use
gcc-4.8 -mcpu=cortex-a7 -mfpu=neon-vfpv4 -mfloat-abi=hard

This gave me the best code and was the only option that enabled sdiv/udiv.
To get gcc 4.8 just do
sudo apt-get install gcc-4.8

For gcc 4.6 (the default compiler on rasbian)
gcc -march=armv7-a -mfpu=neon-vfpv4 -mfloat-abi=hard

For a Pi 1 (B+)
gcc -mcpu=arm1176jzf-s -mfpu=vfp -mfloat-abi=hard

Hope this helps.

And when compiling large projects on the Pi2, use "make -j 4" to take advantage of the extra cores
